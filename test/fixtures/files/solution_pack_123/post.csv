39,12,9,My mentor and I have become very good friends over the last two quarters and they just sent me a Facebook request last night.  I have heard a lot about not friending colleagues and I have some questionable pictures that I wouldnâ€™t want them to see.  What should I do? ,2014-08-07 11:11:40 UTC,2014-08-07 11:11:40 UTC,,,,,,

I'm currently putting together a brochure that will communicate the benefits of our MBA program.  As part of this piece I would like to include a few short quotes from you to show how the program works and show that the participants really like it.
