Dear Mentees

We have organized a lunch and networking event next friday at our cafeteria between noon and 2.00pm. Don't miss it as this gives an opportunity to meet your mentors and other experienced people in person, build your professional and help network while enjoying a great lunch.

Warm regards,

Program Administrator
