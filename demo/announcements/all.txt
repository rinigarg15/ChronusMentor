Dear Mentors and Mentees,

Congratulations on your decision to participate in the program! We believe that not only will you find the program rewarding but you will also gain much more than your investment into the program.

Thank you for being a part of our program. We look forward to assisting you in making this experience as pleasant and rewarding as possible.

We encourage you to spend time reviewing the contents of Program overview pages, before your first meeting with your mentor or your mentee so the two of you can develop a roadmap for your relationship.

Mentoring is a successful strategy for development at any age. Our goal is to help students succeed in life; to discover how to unlock and achieve his or her potential. Mentors will also have a satisfying and enjoyable experience.

We appreciate your involvement in the program and your continued support of this program! We look forward to seeing you again at future mentor events and receiving your evaluation of this program next fall. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us with questions, comments or feedback. 


Warm regards,

Program Administrator
