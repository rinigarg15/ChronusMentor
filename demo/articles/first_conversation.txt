<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, introduce yourself and build rapport. Building rapport simply means attempting to get to know someone on a personal level. It might be helpful to reread your mentor&rsquo;s profile and ask questions based on the information they provided.   Following are some question ideas to ask your mentor. Choose a couple beforehand and then let the conversation flow.</p>
<ol>
<li>What was your College experience like?</li>
<li>How did you decide to major in ____?</li>
<li>Did you go to grad school immediately after graduating from college?</li>
<li>If not, what did you do? What was it like for you after graduating from College?</li>
<li>Did you study abroad while you were at College?</li>
<li>What is your favorite memory of College?</li>
</ol>
<p>Rest assured you have your College experience in common, so you will be able to relate on that level. The mentors are excited to talk with you so don&rsquo;t worry too much about saying the right things.</p>
