<p><b>Ideas for Mentor-Mentee Activities</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Socialize with other mentor-mentee pairs.</li>
<li>Have lunch or dinner at a local eatery – share your favorite spots with each other. Eating together is an important relationship builder.</li>
<li>Attend a campus lecture, performance or a sporting event together.</li>
<li>Attend a alumni organization sponsored event.</li>
<li>Volunteer a few hours to help an alumni organization, campus, or communityorganized event.</li>
<li>Introduce each other to your favorite types of movies, concerts, festivals, art exhibits, and cultural events.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Alumni‐Student Program will periodically sponsor events to assist in facilitating relationships. These events will provide opportunities for mentor-student interaction and develop a sense of community among the participants.</p>
