<p><b>From Mentors</b></p>

<ul>
<li>It's been great being able to share my personal experiences as well as hear about student life and how much things have changed on campus. I really enjoy providing perspective and helping as much as possible by providing information and knowledge about my life after College.</li>

<li>The most rewarding aspect of my mentoring is hearing about all the exciting activities and studies students are involved in at school and knowing they are going to make a great impact on the world.</li>

<li>The most rewarding aspect of being a mentor is the interactions with my mentee – she is an absolute joy to be around.</li>

<li>Helping someone pursue their dreams is always a great feeling. Its about sharing experiences, sharing my learning, both professional and personal. Where mentorship works best is where you share common bond.</li>

<p><b>From Mentees</b></p>

<li>Those very first days at university are the hardest, and although they seem trivial after a while, they are in fact the foundations of our university experience. Simple questions like finding where your first lectures are going to be, how to sign up for tutorials and laboratories, and find your way around campus are the most common unknowns.
My mentor was very helpful. Not only did she help me find my way around, but also introduced me to many other students so I could develop friendships.</li>

<li>After that first year I felt inspired to become a mentor myself, and make difference. I have made great friends along the way. We start out with a mentor/mentee relationship but it turns into friendship right after, and that is when it becomes rewarding. Of course, it doesn’t always works this well since we all have different needs and personalities, but it is a nice feeling to know that there is someone you can reach in any case.</li>

<li>My mentor really convinced me to shoot for my dreams and that they are possible and feasible</li>

<li>My mentor has been amazing, and has provided me with exceptional guidance. He has been very helpful in answering all of my questions, and has great suggestions</li>

<li>The most rewarding aspect of having a mentor has been his advice and critique of my resume and cover letter, answering lots of questions, talking about internship searching and advice about certain classes to take</li>

<li>My mentor a financial analyst gave me help in establishing goals and also in dealing with my personal life. His advice was to put family first, work hard and play hard. He gave me support but encouraged me to make my own decisions.</li>

<li>We discussed my future plans, career goals and how to navigate those goals and plans. Having a mentor gives you someone, who can relate to what you want to do in life. A friend or parent might not be as well informed about that particular area.</li>
