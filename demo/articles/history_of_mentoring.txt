<p>Mentoring began in ancient Greek methodology at Ithaca of ancient Greece. Around 1200 B.C. Odysseus, King of Ithaca, was leaving for the siege of Troy when he appointed his friend, Mentor, to be a surrogate father to his son, Telemachus. Mentor’s responsibility was to guide and teach the young prince and to shape the future king’s character and values by leading by example.</p>

<p>Craft guilds founded in the Middle Ages show examples of mentoring. Young men were apprenticed to master craftsmen working in specific professions such as merchandising, law, or gold smithing. These apprenticeships were forerunners to the employer/employee relationship models found in the industrial society.</p>

<p>Over the years, informal mentoring relationships have advanced careers and guided skill building through a profession or organization. As societies become more complex and impersonal, the need for person-to-person mentoring becomes even more important. People must develop skills to succeed in today's complex and rapidly changing job market. As a result, mentoring assumes an emphasis beyond the standard faculty/student and employer/employee relationships.</p>
