Here we are 5 weeks into this program and I am feeling less than motivated to participate and take the time out of my busy schedule to deal with my mentee.  She is a little clingy and I really don't have that much time for her.  I think I just need a little motivation to keep helping her along.  Can you all tell me why you love the program?  Maybe that would help me get out of this valley. , It can get tough at times, but I just always think back to when I was in my Master's program and how I really could have used a mentor. It took me a little while to be able to naturally fit the time commitment into my schedule, but I have been doing the program for 3 years now and knowing that I am helping young professionals is very rewarding. , A month ago, one of my mentees called from last year's program and told me that she just got hired on as the Vice President of Global Product Development at Starbucks. She worked so hard throughout her degree to build up her resume. It was so great to hear from her. That is what motivates me.
