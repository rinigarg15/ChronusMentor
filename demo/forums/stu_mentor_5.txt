Hi Mentors!
I'm currently putting together a brochure that will communicate the benefits of our MBA program.  As part of this piece I would like to include a few short quotes from you to show how the program works and show that the participants really like it.

If you would like to participate I will hold an informal check-in/testimonial session next Thursday at 6pm.  If you can make it, let me know.

Thanks , I'll be there. , Me too! , I can't make that time. Can we set up an alternate time? I can stop by your office sometime.
