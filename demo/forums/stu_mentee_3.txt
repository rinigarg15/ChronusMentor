I was unable to make it to the Career Steps Seminar last Thursday.  Did anybody happen to take notes that I could take a look at.  I really wanted to hear Don speak but it just didn't work out.

Thanks! , It was a really good seminar. I'll send you the notes that I took; I think they're a pretty good summary of the main points. I think that there is a video too.
