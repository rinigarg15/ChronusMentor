I'm currently preparing for the job fair next week and I need some tips.  I've never been to a career fair before and was wondering if anyone could tell me what to expect and how to prepare. , I found this great article of 7 tips to be successful at a career fair: http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobseeker/careerfairs/careerfairtips.aspx Hope this helps! , I went to a job fair last month and ran out of resumes before I got halfway through all of the reps. That was a big mistake. Bring lots of resumes!!
