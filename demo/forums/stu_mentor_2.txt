I got a request last night from a mentee who would like to connect with me because of my background in Finance.  Unfortunately, I have switched over to more of the Information Systems side of the business world and am a little out of touch with the industry.  Is anybody in Finance who would like to take on another mentee?, Send them my way. I would be glad to take on another mentee!
