Three weeks ago I got a new mentor.  As of today, I haven't heard a single thing from her.  I've emailed her and sent her a message, but she hasn't responded.  Does anyone have suggestions of what I should do? , Maybe try to get a second mentor. My mentor, Sean, is really helpful. We've had coffee a couple of times and he is really responsive to my emails. , I had a similar problem with a detached mentor. I would suggest: 1) try to call or Skype them or 2) talk to the admin. Both of these options might be a little uncomfortable, but I found them to both be effective when I was trying to engage my mentor. Hope this helps :)
