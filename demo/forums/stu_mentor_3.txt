I'm trying to decide what the best way to stay in touch with my mentee is.  I work near campus, so I could meet her in person, but I would much rather maintain a virtual connection.  Are there any alternatives to Skype that have been successful? , I really think that Skype is the best option. It's capabilities are beyond anything else I have seen. If you want a tutorial, I would be glad to give you one.","You might also want to try Google Talk. There is a video feature that is very handy and you dont have to download the app.
