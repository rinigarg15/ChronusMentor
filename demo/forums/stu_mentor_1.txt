I just wanted to pass along some success I had with my mentee.  About a month ago, we worked together to define what he wants his career to look like.  After a couple different excercises, we narrowed his potential employers list down to 3.  We then went through and researched and prepared for each of the 3 interviews like it was his only one.  He got 2 offers and is starting in a high-level management role at Amazon next month.  So excited for him! , Congrats to you and your mentee! The hard work seems to have paid off. , I did something very similar with one of my mentees recently. She also had success with this process.
