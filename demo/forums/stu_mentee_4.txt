My mentor and I have become very good friends over the last two quarters and they just sent me a Facebook request last night.  I have heard a lot about not friending colleagues and I have some questionable pictures that I wouldnâ€™t want them to see.  What should I do? , I have been Facebook friends with my mentor for 3 months and haven't had any problems. I, too, have some pictures that might not be completely appropriate, but nothing has caused any awkwardness between my mentor and I. I would say you should friend them. You might think about creating a professional profile. I have some friends that have liked having two separate profiles.
