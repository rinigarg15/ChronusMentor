"Create a vision - set your goals","<div> <p> Before you move beyond getting to know each other, you and your mentee should set concrete goals.</p> <p> We encourage mentees to take charge of setting pace and direction, and to explore with you how you can help with goal attainment. You can help with goal-setting by holding your mentee accountable for developing and recording goals.</p> <p> Your mentee has been sent the following questions. Ask your mentee to answer them honestly and thoughtfully. This exercise develops mentoring goals and the beginnings of a roadmap</p> <ul> <li> <strong>What are your goals for this mentoring relationship?</strong> (e.g., competency development, career advancement, leadership skills development, gain knowledge in a particular topic area, etc.)</li> <li> <strong>How will you know if you reached these goals?</strong> (e.g., improved performance, promoted, attained a new credential, etc.)</li> <li> <strong>What challenges can you anticipate?</strong> (e.g., availability of advancement opportunities, need to further your formal education, length of time needed to develop a new skill or competency)</li> </ul> <p> Additionally, take a moment to reflect on your own personal goals. Beyond the rewards of helping to shape another&#39;s growth, is there anything you wish to develop? Do you want to become a better mentor, communicator, listener, or leader? Are you seeking greater self-awareness and fresh perspectives? You will get more out of mentoring if you keep your goals in mind from the start.</p></div><br />","mentor",14,,,,
"Create a vision - set your goals","<div class=""well square-well bg-highlight""> Before you and your mentor progress beyond getting to know each other, you will need to set concrete goals.</div><div> <p> Success in mentoring requires you to understand your needs, set your goals accordingly, and discuss with your mentor how to accomplish them. Start by answering the following questions:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>What are your goals for this mentoring relationship?</strong> (e.g., complete requirements for the degree, find an internship or job, get admitted to graduate schools)</li> <li> <strong>How will you know if you reached these goals?</strong> (e.g., being able to graduate as intended, receiving an offer to work in the area of your interest, getting an acceptance letter to grad schools)</li> <li> <strong>What challenges can you anticipate?</strong> (e.g., not sure about the availability of certain courses, job market is slow, applications are time consuming to complete)</li> </ol> <p> Once you set concrete goals, you will find it easier to make the best use of time with your mentor.</p></div><br />","mentee",14,,,,
"Mentoring tips","<div> <p> There are several traits that will help you to be an effective mentor:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Inspire</strong> - What makes mentors effective may very well rest in the ability to inspire their mentees. By setting an example, you may be able to motivate your mentee towards future paths that are beyond his or her original dreams. Challenge your mentee to find importance in what he or she aspires to do. Help your mentee create a future vision.</li> <li> <strong>Be an Active Listener</strong> - A sign of good listening is that your mentee feels he or she has been clearly heard and understood. Your mentee feels accepted and puts more&nbsp;trust in the mentoring relationship. One form of active listening is remembering or showing interest in things your mentee mentioned in the past.</li> <li> <strong>Share Similar Experiences</strong> - Mentors are not expected to be superheroes. Most of the time, they are people who have already experienced situations similar to those their mentees now face. By sharing your experiences, you can help your mentee feel more empowered to deal with challenges successfully.</li> <li> <strong>Provide Corrective Feedback in an Encouraging Manner</strong> - It is not easy to take feedback well. However, hearing it in a motivating and encouraging tone can help your mentee accept and apply feedback readily.</li> <li> <strong>Speak of Your Mentee in Positive or Neutral Ways</strong> - Your mentee needs to trust that your discussions are confidential and that the mentoring relationship is mutually supportive. When speaking of your mentee to others, provide only positive or neutral comments.</li> </ul></div><br />","Mentor",21,,,,
"Effective online communication","<p> In person, you can convey meaning with facial expressions and hand gestures. On the phone, you still have voice modulation. These cues are missing in written communication, and without them it is a skill and an art to communicate effectively. The better people can express themselves, the more their relationships will deepen. When communicating through writing, the following tips will help prevent miscommunication.</p><div> <ul> <li> <strong>Meaningful Subject Line</strong> - A good subject line ensures that the recipient recognizes the importance of your message and doesn&#39;t delete it accidentally. The subject line should also serve as a summary, giving your mentee a clear idea of the topic you want to discuss.</li> <li> <strong>Clear and Concise Messages</strong> - Take the time to write clear, concise messages. Correspondingly, if you receive messages that are not clear and concise, take the time to get clarification. Were your mentee&#39;s points clear to you? If not, give your mentee an opportunity to restate, elaborate or reconsider the intended message.</li> <li> <strong>Investigating Assumptions</strong> - Consider what assumptions your mentee may have made, whether implicit or explicit. To uncover assumptions and prevent misinterpretations, state your understanding of the mentee&#39;s message or ask your mentee to clarify.</li> <li> <strong>Communicating about Communication</strong> - It is very important to inform your mentee of your schedule well in advance. This prevents the unnecessary frustration of a communication breakdown.</li> </ul></div><p> Online messaging has its challenges, but it also has advantages in many situations, especially when done thoughtfully.

"Networking tips","<div class=""well square-well bg-highlight""> In your daily life, you probably network all the time simply by meeting, connecting, and keeping in touch with others. You know firsthand that quality relationships can enrich your life and empower you to achieve your goals. Your mentee likely also realizes that it&#39;s important to develop and maintain a strong network, and would appreciate hearing your personal approach. Some suggestions on how to help:</div><div> <ul> <li> Let your mentee know if networking helped you professionally, such as to find your current job, a promotion, or clients.</li> <li> If appropriate, share ideas about communication skills, such as smiling when meeting people, maintaining eye contact, active listening, body language, complimenting, and finding common interests over which to connect.</li> <li> Share techniques for starting conversations with new people, such as an opening line when meeting people, a list of getting-to-know-you questions, or ideas for casual conversation.</li> <li> Share your thoughts on frowned-upon practices, such as coercion, manipulation of others, and contacting long-forgotten connections only when you need something such as a job referral.</li> <li> Finally, we hope you will be willing to share a few contacts that may help your mentee reach his or her goals.</li> </ul></div><br />","mentor",70,,,,
"Networking tips","Networking is a learned skill that takes time and practice to improve. Your mentor has likely leveraged a network of contacts at various times in life.
