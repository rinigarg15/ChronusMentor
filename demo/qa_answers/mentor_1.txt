The initial contact should be an informal one.  This is a time to get to know each other by sharing about significant events or people in each other’s life, likes and dislikes, and general interests.  First conversation topics should provide a glimpse into each other’s lives.  You should also discuss the best method(s) of communication with each other and how often you will communicate.  At the end of the meeting, arrangements should be made for a second meeting.  The second meeting is a good time to discuss in more detail what each person wants to gain from the relationship.
