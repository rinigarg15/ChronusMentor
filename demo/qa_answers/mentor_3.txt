When you first meet or speak with your mentee, you should establish a preferred method of communication (phone, email, Facebook, etc.). It is highly recommended to establish a schedule for communicating so that you and the mentee know when to expect to hear from each other. Though this may seem highly regimented, we believe that it helps keep the relationship going when both of you get busy. Be sure to discuss scheduling with your mentee at any point of time.
