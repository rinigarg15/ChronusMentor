      description_v2: Sometimes participants have long periods of no noticeable %{_program} activity. If the %{_program} requires a certain amount of activity, %{_a_admin} may wish to let participants know that a greater level of participation is expected. There is a setting in the %{_program} that %{_a_admin} can enable to prompt their users to be more active in their %{_mentoring_connections}. The default trigger is 30 days but the %{_admin} can modify that time period. After those number of inactive days, inactive %{_mentoring_connection} %{_mentors} and/or %{_mentees} get this email. The %{_mentoring_connection} is NOT automatically terminated.
