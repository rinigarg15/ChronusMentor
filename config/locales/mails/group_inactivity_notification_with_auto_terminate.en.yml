      description_v2: Sometimes participants have long periods of no noticeable %{_program} activity. If the %{_program} requires a certain amount of activity, %{_a_admin} may choose to close the participant's %{_mentoring_connection}. There is a setting in the %{_program} that %{_a_admin} can enable to automatically terminate a participant from the %{_program}. The %{_admin} can set the default trigger time period. After those number of inactive days, inactive %{_mentoring_connection} %{_mentors} and/or %{_mentees} get this email. The %{_mentoring_connection} IS automatically terminated.
