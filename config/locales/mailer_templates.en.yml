      preview_message_v1: This feature should be used to test copy and layout. It will not generate content for placeholders correctly, so expect some missing data. For example, you may see a fake term or blank space in place of {{tag}}. Web hyperlinks also may not work. Rest assured that in real scenarios, placeholders and links will work correctly.
