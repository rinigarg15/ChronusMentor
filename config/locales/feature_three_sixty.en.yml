          competency_summary: The survey focused on the following competencies -
        para_2_v1: The bar-charts below summarise your ratings broken down by competency. Each competency categorises your ratings by reviewer category (eg Peers, Managers, etc.) and averages responses for questions within the competency. Each competency is then broken down by questions and represented on bar-charts categorised by reviewer category.
        para_3_v1: The primary data is ‘normed’. This means that we take your rating (e.g. 4 out of 5) and compare it to all the other ratings we have received for that question.
        para_4_v1: If, for example, 80% of the ratings we have received are above 4 for that particular measure. then your normed score will be 20%.
        para_5: 'The results of the survey may help you decide which areas to focus on. We suggest that you take other data into account besides these survey results in framing your intentions, including: direct feedback from your work colleagues, the results of other surveys, and your perception of which behaviours are most important at the moment in helping you achieve your goals in the workplace.'
        para_6: However, while interpreting your report, please remember that the ratings are based upon perceptions of the people who rated you, at the time they rated you, based on their understanding of the questions, which tend to be more subjective than objective.
