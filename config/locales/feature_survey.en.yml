        margin_error_text_html: Survey results themselves are only a measure of how the sample of selected individuals that responded felt about the issue; they don't reflect how the entire population may have felt, had they all responded. Results based on a sample may not be exactly the same as what you might have found for the entire population. The margin of error helps you estimate how close you are to the truth about the population based on your sample data. <br> </br> To compute this margin of error, we are using the confidence level as 95%. Confidence level is the probability that your sample accurately reflects the attitudes of your population. The industry standard is 95%. For example, if you have an 85% satisfaction rate and 10% margin of error, we can say with 95% confidence that your overall population has an actual satisfaction rate between 75-95%.
