The SOAPAuth folder contains the WSDL files and the YML files required for SOAP authentication.

INTEGRITY
=========

To maintain the integrity of the folder contents,

digest.yml file, which contains the digest for all the folders, is included. The values in the file are compared against the digest computed during the execution of test/unit/lib/authentication_models/soap_auth_test.rb

GENERATE DIGEST
===============

Whenever the folder contents are updated INTENTIONALLY,

update the digest.yml with the digest computed using the below command
find <FOLDER_PATH> -type f | sort -u | xargs cat | md5sum
