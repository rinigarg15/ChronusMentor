In order to get you signed up on GetMentoring.com you will need to follow the steps below:<br /><br />1. Create a BYU Net ID at <a href=""https://lambda.byu.edu/ae/prod/person/cgi/createNetId.cgi"">https://lambda.byu.edu/ae/prod/person/cgi/createNetId.cgi</a>.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about filling out the SS# field since you are not a BYU student or employee.<br /><br />2. Once your Net ID is created, return to this email and <a href=""{{url_invitation}}"">click here</a> to accept the invitation and sign up for BYU&#39;s Mentoring Program {{as_role_name_articleized}} on GetMentoring.com. (Note: You will be prompted to log in using your newly created BYU Net ID and password.)<br /><br />3. Complete the profile creation process. If you don&#39;t have all of the information, or the time to properly fill out every section you can always edit your profile after the fact inside the site. (Note: The question regarding the &ldquo;maximum number of mentees you wish to mentor&rdquo; does not apply to our program so don&rsquo;t worry about changing it.)<br /><br />4. Once inside the system you can add mentoring availability slots by clicking on the &quot;My Availability&quot; tab. The calendar utilizes an interactive drag interface so just click on a given day and drag downwards to create an availability slot.<br /><br />5. There are two prerequisites found in the I&rsquo;m a Mentor portion of the GetMentoring.com site:&nbsp; read Nail It Then Scale It, and the mentor Code of Conduct. Please review and agree and check the appropriate yes boxes when setting up your profile. (There is a summary of the book on the prerequisite portion of the website.)<br /><br />6. Qualified students can access the mentoring system and self-select the mentor that best fits their current need based in part on the profile you create.<br /><br />If you have any problems or questions during the steps above feel free to contact me, or Jeff Brown, at the information in the signature below.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />Jeff Howlett<br />Director of Venture Mentoring Services<br />Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology at BYU<br />venturementoring@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />801.422.7437<br /><br />Jeff Brown<br />GetMentoring.com Admin<br />jeff.brown@byu.edu<br />801-422-2815</i><br />",Invitation: You are invited to join BYU's Mentoring Program {{as_role_name_articleized}}
